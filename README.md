ABOUT ME

Hello World! I'm Lura, an aspiring web developer passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly web applications. 
I'm completing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) from AMA Computer College.

This is my first time putting my work on GitHub; usually, I keep it on my local computer because it was intimidating. However, I believe it's part of the process. I have to learn and grow as a developer. 
It's humbling to realize that I know nothing and there are many things to learn from others. It's a continuous journey, and there's no finish line in learning.
